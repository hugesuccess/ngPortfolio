        <p class="padding-bottom">When I started writing software one of my biggest challenges was not how to write the actual software code, I had a solid understanding of the languages, because that's what they teach you in school. My biggest challenge was -- "what to write"?</p>

        <p class="padding-top">This is how I structure my tutoring sessions, by not only teaching you the underlying fundamentals of JavaScript, but in the process of teaching you these fundamentals we walk you through the modern web development (link). You'll gain an understanding of how JavaScript works from a structural level, while using modern tools and frameworks which front-end developers use everyday.</p>
